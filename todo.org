** Notes
- Whirlpool WFW94HEAW: 6/93 reviews are 3 stars or less and for
  complaints about holes in clothes, cycle time, a water problem of
  some sort, and a bad bearing. Not bad. HD doesn't carry that model,
  but the reviews are much, much lower for the Whirlpools they do
  carry (3.9/72, 2.7/19, and 3.6/17)
- LG2650 paired dryer gets not so hot reviews on reliability with the
  gas, but the electric has 85 reviews and 4.8/5 average. Odd.
- LG3070 has 4.8 (gas, n=5) and 4.9 (elec, n=26) reviews on dryers (HD).
- LG3470 has 5.0 (gas, n=11) and 4.9 (elec, n=31) reviews on dryers
  (Lowes), and 4.8 (gas, n=46) and 4.7 (elec, n=83) at HD. 

In general, LG was featured quite heavily in the top rated washers via
Consumer Reports, however the only local place they're sold appears
to be Sears, which has a much smaller sample size for the ratins
(~20-30). LG, in contrast, has some 4-500 reviews for various models
from Lowes/HD ratings alone, and they are unbelievably high (4.8-4.9).

Looking at HD, there were a lot of lower (< 4.0, reasonable N)
ratings for Whirlpool, whereas all the ~3.5 f^{3} LGs (4 of them)
weren't lower than 4.5, with sample sizes of 64, 213, 267,
and 349. Impressive.

- [[http://applianceassistant.com/news/washerBrandReliability.php][reliability ratings]]: not sure where they get their data, but LG,
  Whirlpool, and Frigidaire are the best rated for front load washer
  reliability (9-11% major repair rate).

#+begin_quote 
As a rule of thumb, to accomodate a king-sized comforter, a washer
capacity of 3.8 cu. ft. (IEC) or greater is required. For a
queen-sized comforter, approximately 3.5 cu. ft. (IEC) or more is
needed. 
#+end_quote

- [[http://www.theworldofwashers.com/2009/03/lowdown-on-capacity-frontload-washers.html][size guide]]: says 2.9 DOE = 3.5 IEC, 3.3 DOE = 4.2 IEC. So, 3.6 f^3
  should be plenty for big loads (> 4.2).
