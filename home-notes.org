** Screencasting
- ffcast2 via someone on arch works alright, thought it seems that ffmpeg by itself might
  work fine. ffcast2 works great by default, but without sound. After all the options
  needed to provide to ffmpeg for sound, it's unclear what advantage ffcast2
  offers. https://github.com/lolilolicon/FFcast2
- freeseer: sounds quite promising. https://github.com/fosslc/freeseer

* PMT Script

I'm John Henderson in 3M's Automotive Aftermarket Division. Most of my life is hilarious,
but today I'd like to talk about something serious: male baldness as a result of
participating in a study for 3M Medical's prototype pre-operative shaver. This is no
laughing matter.

As an innovative engineer, however, I know there's a solution for everything. Thanks to
3M's recently launched PMT, or Automotive Precision Masking Tape if you're not into the
whole brevity thing, we're going to fix this chrome dome right up.

Thankfully, PMT utilizes a smooth Washi paper backing so we won't have to deal with any of
those unsightly built up paint edges that other tapes leave behind on bald heads. PMT also
features excellent adhesive wet out properties for low removal force. This means I
get a look that's a killer with the ladies... without killing my scalp.

Well, I think we'll get right down to it. I'm here with PMT lead developer and precision
masker, Jeff Schwab to demo the raw power and versatility of PMT.

[Starts masking]

Hey Jeff, leave me some sideburns, will you? I don't want to look like a weirdo.

[Paint]

With today's advanced paint systems, don't try and cut corners on the bake cycle.

[Hairdry/demask]

Well, there you have it. Another win for 3M's line of automotive masking solutions. Thanks for
joining us and next time you're looking for an automotive masking tape, choose PMT. It'll
really put some hair on your head.

* EVO 4g s-off/unlock/root

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2026938 helped unlock

Downloaded files from [[http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2026938][this XDA post]]. Unzip the download and cd into the directory from a
terminal. Needed files:
- fastboot-linux
- openrecovery-twrp-2.5.0.0-jewel.img

Some people have problems with various versions of TWRP. The full list of versions is
[[http://techerrata.com/browse/twrp2/jewel][here]] if you'd like to try some different ones.

Pretty simple after that:
- Follow [[http://www.htcdev.com/bootloader][HTC Dev instructions]] to unlock bootloader
- Boot into fastboot (power + vol down), power on "fastboot" menu entry, plug in usb
  cable
- Install TWRP:

#+begin_example
$ sudo ./fastboot-linux flash recovery openrecovery-twrp-2.5.0.0-jewel.img
$ sudo ./fastboot-linux erase cache
#+end_example

The instructions say to choose the "bootloader" menu option and then the "recovery" menu
option. This didn't work for my and my phone just rebooted, so I just powered off again,
then powered on (holding vol down) and then chose "recovery" from the main bootloader
menu. From there, TWRP started up just fine.

Now we're at step 6b from the Unlimited.io instructions. Download and unzip the
babyracun.zip files, then boot into recovery. What wasn't clear for me is that this means
you're booting into TWRP (I guess it's implied, but I checked on their IRC channel to
verify and you should be looking at the TWRP main menu when you issue the =adb= commands).

If the reboot takes you back to the bootloader screen and you see =fastboot usb= in red,
issue the =sudo ./fastboot oem lock= command. Step 9 was straightforward (though took
quite a long time to flash the RUU.zip file). My attempt did, indeed, fail with the error:

#+begin_quote
FAILED (remote: 90 hboot pre-update! please flush image again immediately)
#+end_quote

I simply pressed the up arrow from Linux and hit enter and it was successful the second
time. Proceed with the HTC Dev unlock process you already went through, which I believe
shut my device down after I accepted to unlock via the phone when asked. Boot up normally
(I skipped all the setup stuff), then enable USB Debugging from the Settings -> Developer
Options menu.

Now type =sudo ./RabiesShot= from the terminal and wait. My first attempt looked like
this:

#+begin_example
Starting up...
Testing connection...
Test 1: Rebooting into bootloader
Waiting fastboot (17/60)
Waiting...
Test 2: Booting device...
Waiting ADB... (60/60)
Test 2: Booting FAILED
Reboot device manually
Connection test failed!
#+end_example

I believe this left my phone off, so I simply started back up, verified that USB
debugging was still enabled, and then re-ran the command. The full output looked like
this (successful):

#+begin_example


Starting up...
Testing connection...
Test 1: Rebooting into bootloader
Waiting fastboot (17/60)

Test 2: Booting device...
Waiting ADB... (10/60)

#+end_example

At one point I was prompted on whether I wanted to activate my device. I reacted and
tapped OK, but am not sure if the program would have done that itself or not. Everything
finished just fine.

Then I re-flashed TWRP using the method above. Next, to look for a custom ROM. I settled
on Mean Bean based on good reviews/opinions and being pretty stock/simple. At this point,
I noticed I was now on software 3.15.651.16 instead of my former 3.16.351.3. My radio
version was also less than it was after I took the latest OTA from Sprint.

Used firmware [[http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1704612][here]] (actual downloads are [[http://themikmik.com/showthread.php?13192-RADIOS-RECOVERY-FLASHABLE-Jewel-Radio-Collection&p=220556&viewfull=1#post220556][here]]).

* HTC EVO rom fiddling
- SlimRom: can't stand that they make the unlock screen icon the slim logo. Really not
  digging that and will never use Slim until I find out that's a changeable option.
- [[http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2396173][PACman]]: bloated, but they came out with 4.3, so giving it a try. [[http://pac-rom.com/#Download][Official]] site.
- JellyBAM: bloated and had an issue with a never-ending boot-up once
- RootBox was buggy: pulled down settings bar and went to swipe from profiles to
  settings/quick panel and it would freeze mid-rotate (you could see the icons, but they
  never flattened out and came into view. They were rotated at an angle and pixelated).
- [[http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2420496][Bean Stalk 2.0]]: based on 4.3
- [[http://www.evervolv.com/devices/jewel][Evervolv]]: has 4.3 roms as well as older

  somehow, but I'm not sure I follow. They supposedly install to /system instead of to the
  internal SD, which is better for more "system" apps
