** Screencasting
- ffcast2 via someone on arch works alright, thought it seems that ffmpeg by itself might
  work fine. ffcast2 works great by default, but without sound. After all the options
  needed to provide to ffmpeg for sound, it's unclear what advantage ffcast2
  offers. https://github.com/lolilolicon/FFcast2
- freeseer: sounds quite promising. https://github.com/fosslc/freeseer

* PMT Script

I'm John Henderson in 3M's Automotive Aftermarket Division. Most of my life is hilarious,
but today I'd like to talk about something serious: male baldness as a result of
participating in a study for 3M Medical's prototype pre-operative shaver. This is no
laughing matter.

As an innovative engineer, however, I know there's a solution for everything. Thanks to
3M's recently launched PMT, or Automotive Precision Masking Tape if you're not into the
whole brevity thing, we're going to fix this chrome dome right up.

Thankfully, PMT utilizes a smooth Washi paper backing so we won't have to deal with any of
those unsightly built up paint edges that other tapes leave behind on bald heads. PMT also
features excellent adhesive wet out properties for low removal force. This means I
get a look that's a killer with the ladies... without killing my scalp.

Well, I think we'll get right down to it. I'm here with PMT lead developer and precision
masker, Jeff Schwab to demo the raw power and versatility of PMT.

[Starts masking]

Hey Jeff, leave me some sideburns, will you? I don't want to look like a weirdo.

[Paint]

With today's advanced paint systems, don't try and cut corners on the bake cycle.

[Hairdry/demask]

Well, there you have it. Another win for 3M's line of automotive masking solutions. Thanks for
joining us and next time you're looking for an automotive masking tape, choose PMT. It'll
really put some hair on your head.
