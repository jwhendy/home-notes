* Cookie assignment

I researched exothermic reactions for some time. In the end, I wasn't satisfied that any
of them would be 1) common (wanted this to be something the "average Joe" could replicate
without much of a shopping trip hassle), 2) safe for me, or 3) safe for the consumer of
the cookie. In any case, here were some that came up:

- Googling "common household exothermic reactions"
  - Yeast and H_{2}O_{2}[fn:1]
  -
