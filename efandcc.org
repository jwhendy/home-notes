* Cookie assignment

For this assignment, I brainstormed a few ideas before settling on my "Manhattanookie."

** Fun ways to eat cookies

blah


** Exothermic reaction for "ovenless cookies"

I thought it would be neat if cookies could be cooked without an oven, via an exothermic
chemical reaction hot enough to bake the cookies in a double boiler or pressure cooker.

I researched exothermic reactions for some time. In the end, I wasn't satisfied that any
of them would be 1) common (wanted this to be something the "average Joe" could replicate
without much of a shopping trip hassle), 2) safe for me, or 3) safe for the consumer of
the cookie. In any case, here were some that came up in googling "common household exothermic reactions:"
  - Yeast and H_{2}O_{2}[fn:1]
  - Water and acid or anhydrous salt[fn:2]
  - Potassium permanganate and glycerin[fn:3]
  - Aluminum foil and sodium hydroxide (Draino)[fn:3]
  - Iron filings, salt, and H_{2}O_{2}[fn:3]
  - Potato or blood and H_{2}O_{2} (can't re-find the site at the moment)

In the end, I worried about these being either hazardous to myself or perhaps releasing
gas that might absorb into the cookie. Some forums would relate the "ideal forumla" but
then note that some alternative compounds might be created if not enough of one of the
reactants was present.

Probably not a good idea!

** Alcoholic cookies!

My beverage of choice is whisky :) Many food recipes feature alcohol as a cooking
additive, but it cooks off. Could I get liquid alcohol into a cookie?

Current IP investigation: googling "liquor filled cookies," "alcoholic cookies," "whisky
filled cookies."
- There were many examples of liquor filled pies, chocolate balls, Tiramisu, etc.[fn:4]
- Same results at another site[fn:5]
- Whisky-infused cherries in a cookie[fn:6]

There were lots of other similar results, but none seemed to feature the combination of a
cookie as the main dessert form and liquid, non-cooked-off whisky. Yay!

I needed something to house the liquor. I originally thought of dental wax (trying to
make two thin film circles into a pouch. Tapping my network yielded only lab-use only
dental wax, so that was out. I also got a suggestion for cooking wax (thanks PJ!), but in
reading a bit about this, I found out that paraffin is typically used and that the
canning stuff you can get is not necessarily food-grade. That aside, I couldn't find any
at Target or Rainbow anyway, so I fell back on chocolate.

I made a test container to see if the alcohol would stay sealed overnight. It more or
less did, though I got a leak. I couldn't tell if the chocolate itself dissolved enough
to leak, or if trying to seal those rough-made cups had featured a pinhole of some
sort. Inspecting the inside, it didn't look like much chocolate had softened/dissolved.

As for the cookies themselves, I wanted them to be soft and chewy. Found some potential
base recipes to work from. Top choices:
- Googling "soft chocolate chip cookie" yielded [[http://allrecipes.com/recipe/award-winning-soft-chocolate-chip-cookies/][Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies]]
- Googline "moist chewy cookie recipe" yielded [[http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-big-fat-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookie/][Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie]]

Comparing the recipes (after normalizing to the same amount of flour)

#+TBLFM: $2=$-1*(2/4.5)

I considered using the book, /Ratio/, and even reserved it from the library the night of
the class from my phone :) However, 1) it didn't come in time and 2) there were a
reasonable amount of posts like [[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2009/06/one_part_creativity_zero_parts_recipe.single.html][this one]] that suggested the book was a bit simplistic and
that after the promise of a simple ratio and exlanation early on the in the book, the rest
of the pages were filled with caveats and fine print. So... sticking to the above.

After comparing, I had already gone shopping before finding these and don't have vanilla
pudding, so we'll go with the /Big Fat/ cookie recipe. I needed some flavor pairing
ideas, so I googled around. Various sites and forums suggested chocolate, which is good
because I needed to use that anyway to hold the alcohol. Nuts also came up. Other than
that, most hits were more about meal ideas like barbecue pork or steak -- not putting
those in a cookie!

I also had the idea to use cherries, as this is a typical Manhattan garnish. So, with the
base recipe and all of the things I bought, it seemed like DOE time!

|        2x | Walnuts | Yes        | Yes       |

This should yield a decent start. Since the whisky inner container will be chocolate and
the cookie halves will be sealed with chocolate, I decided to not actually use chocolate chips
since I didn't know if they would affect my hopeful ability to seal the cookies
(protruding chips, voids, etc.).

** Results

At the last second, I decided to try two final attempts: one with the sealed inner
container of chocolate/Manhattan, and one with some Manhattan mixed in.

<p>At the last second, I decided to try two final attempts: one with the sealed inner container of chocolate/Manhattan, and one with some Manhattan mixed in to the dough and then cooked. The vermouth definitely didn't cook off well and left an odd taste, or at least that's what I think I tasted. Going with the sealed whisky after all!</p>
<p>Here's the final sealed cookie:</p>
